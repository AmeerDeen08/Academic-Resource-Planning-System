# 📚 Academic Resource Planning System

## Overview

This full stack project focuses on building a centralized platform to manage and streamline academic resources like timetables, faculty schedules, classroom allocations, and course content management. It combines structured data handling with secure access control for different roles such as administrators, faculty members, and students.

The project simulates core elements of campus resource planning systems used in universities and colleges, with a focus on real-time data access and role-based permissions.
